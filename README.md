## Part 1 - Functions Practice
For part 1 we learned how to call functions both with and without parameters. We also learned how to use functions and return values from those functions with the return keyword. Finally, we learned how to create a function that could return different values with the same input based on an if statement. This helps with organizing code as we can put code that would be repeated a lot into one function instead.

## Part 2 - Arrays Practice
For part 2 we learned all about using arrays in php. We got great practice using all of the built in functions like max(), min(), array_push(), array_pop(), array_merge(), array_count_values(). These really helped with manipulating and organizing data such as storing students with their grades.

## Part 3 - Combine Functions and Arrays
For part 3 we learned about combining the use of functions with the use of arrays. We created a function that returns an average vaule from an array of values and used that value in another function. We used the foreach function a lot which is very useful for iterating through an array.
